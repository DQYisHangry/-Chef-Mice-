# Chef Mice — AI-Powered Constraint-Aware Meal Planning Agent

> A stateful, constraint-aware meal planning system that generates intelligent multi-day meal plans, minimizes food waste, and produces targeted shopping lists — powered by Claude AI.

---

## What This Is
This is Chef Mice, a pantry&kitchen helper 🐁👑
This is a **constraint-aware, stateful planning system** that:

- Tracks your current pantry inventory (including expiration dates)
- Learns your dietary and cuisine preferences
- Plans meals across multiple days under real constraints
- Prioritizes ingredients that are about to expire
- Generates a shopping list with reasons for every item
- Updates your inventory state after confirming a plan

```

### Key Design Principle

The LLM is a **reasoning engine, not an orchestrator**. It receives ~20 normalized recipe candidates and returns a ranked list with brief reasoning. It never calls APIs directly, never writes to the database, and is called exactly once per planning request.

## Core Modules

| Module | Responsibility |
|--------|---------------|
| `app/models/` | SQLAlchemy ORM — `UserProfile`, `InventoryItem`, `Recipe`, `MealPlan`, `ShoppingList` |
| `app/schemas/` | Pydantic request/response schemas |
| `app/api/` | FastAPI routers — users, inventory, plans, shopping |
| `app/services/` | Business logic — user CRUD, inventory management |
| `app/agent/` | Planning orchestrator, constraint filtering, LLM ranking *(Milestone 3)* |
| `app/recipes/` | `RecipeProvider` abstraction — local cache, Spoonacular API, hybrid *(Milestone 2)* |
| `app/llm/` | Claude API wrapper *(Milestone 3)* |

---

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| Web framework | FastAPI 0.115 |
| ORM | SQLAlchemy 2.0 (async) |
| Database | SQLite (dev) / PostgreSQL (prod) |
| Migrations | Alembic |
| Validation | Pydantic v2 |
| HTTP client | httpx |
| LLM | Anthropic Claude (claude-sonnet-4-6) |
| Runtime | Python 3.13 |

## Data Models

### UserProfile
Long-term memory — dietary restrictions, cuisine preferences, disliked ingredients, adventurousness (1–5), household size.

### InventoryItem
Short-term state — ingredient name, quantity, unit, type (`perishable` / `shelf_stable` / `spice` / `frozen`), expiration date, soft-delete flag.

### Recipe *(normalized cache)*
Unified schema for all recipe sources. External API results are normalized into this format before the agent sees them. Stores `external_id` + `source` for idempotency and re-normalization.

### MealPlan
Multi-day plan with a JSON `meals` array (`[{date, slot, recipe_id, recipe_name, servings}]`), an `inventory_snapshot` at planning time, and a `constraint_summary` for user transparency.

### ShoppingList
Per-plan shopping list. Every item carries a `reason` field ("needed for Pasta Primavera on Day 3") and a `category` ("produce", "dairy", "pantry") for grouping in a real UI.

## API Reference

### Users
```
POST   /users/                          Create user
GET    /users/{user_id}                 Get profile
PATCH  /users/{user_id}/preferences    Update dietary/cuisine preferences
```

### Inventory
```
GET    /users/{user_id}/inventory               List active inventory (sorted by expiry)
POST   /users/{user_id}/inventory               Add item
PUT    /users/{user_id}/inventory/{item_id}     Update item
DELETE /users/{user_id}/inventory/{item_id}     Soft-delete item
POST   /users/{user_id}/inventory/bulk          Bulk upsert (after a shopping trip)
```

### Plans
```
POST   /users/{user_id}/plans                   Trigger planning agent → MealPlan + ShoppingList
GET    /users/{user_id}/plans                   List past plans
GET    /users/{user_id}/plans/{plan_id}         Get plan detail
POST   /users/{user_id}/plans/{plan_id}/confirm Confirm plan → deduct inventory
DELETE /users/{user_id}/plans/{plan_id}         Cancel draft plan
```

### Shopping
```
GET    /users/{user_id}/plans/{plan_id}/shopping-list
PATCH  /users/{user_id}/plans/{plan_id}/shopping-list/mark-purchased
```

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone and install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/meal-planner.git
cd meal-planner

python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate        # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install email-validator greenlet
```

### 2. Configure environment

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and fill in your keys:

```env
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-key-here
SPOONACULAR_API_KEY=your-key-here   # needed for Milestone 2+
```

### 3. Run

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

Tables are created automatically on first startup (development mode).

Open **http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs** for the interactive API explorer.

## Example Workflow *(once fully implemented)*

```
POST /users/{id}/plans
{
  "days": 5,
  "meals_per_day": ["dinner"],
  "cuisine_override": ["italian", "thai"],
  "extra_constraints": "no nuts this week"
}
```

System internally:
1. Retrieves inventory — sorts by expiration date ascending
2. Retrieves user preferences
3. Queries Spoonacular API filtered by cuisine + dietary tags
4. Normalizes results into internal `Recipe` schema, caches locally
5. Claude ranks ~20 candidates against constraints (one bounded API call)
6. Constraint filter: hard-excludes dietary violations, scores expiry urgency + inventory coverage
7. Assembles 5-day meal plan — expiring ingredients used earliest
8. Generates shopping list — delta between plan needs and current inventory
9. Returns `MealPlan` + `ShoppingList` as draft

User confirms → inventory is deducted.
